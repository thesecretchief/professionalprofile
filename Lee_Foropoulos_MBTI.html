      <p class="text-lg text-gray-600">
        The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), developed by Isabel Briggs Myers and Katharine Cook Briggs, is a globally recognized tool that categorizes individuals into 16 personality types based on four dichotomies: Extraversion/Introversion, Sensing/Intuition, Thinking/Feeling, and Judging/Perceiving. Rooted in Carl Jung’s psychological theories, MBTI provides profound insights into how I perceive the world, make decisions, and interact with others. This framework enhances self-awareness and optimizes workplace compatibility, making it an invaluable asset for professional development. My ENTJ profile, detailed below, reflects my leadership style and interpersonal dynamics, offering a window into my contributions to teams and organizations.
