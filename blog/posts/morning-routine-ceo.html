          People often ask how I manage to run a consulting business, maintain a personal training practice, and stay in competitive shape. The honest answer? There's no magic. It's systems, discipline, and treating my routine like my most important client. Here's exactly how I structure my days.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 dark:text-white">The Philosophy: One Thing at a Time</h2>

        <p>
          Before diving into the specifics, I need to mention the book that fundamentally shaped how I approach each day: <strong><em>The ONE Thing</em></strong> by Gary Keller. The core principle is deceptively simple—identify the single most important task that will make everything else easier or unnecessary, then protect time to execute on it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Keller calls it the "focusing question": <em>What's the one thing I can do such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          I carry this philosophy through every aspect of my day. I think of it as carrying a small stone to chisel away at the big rocks on my weekly priority list. There is never a Plan B—but we're not immutable. When obstacles arise, we improvise within Plan A to keep the ball rolling forward.
        </p>

          <figcaption class="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-3">Training is non-negotiable—it sets the tone for everything else</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 dark:text-white">The Morning: Fuel and Focus</h2>

        <p>
          I wake up early—not because I'm a natural morning person, but because the morning hours are when I have the most control over my environment. Distractions are minimal. The world hasn't started making demands yet.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Breakfast is simple and consistent:</strong> Kodiak Cakes protein muffins most days. They're quick, hit my macros, and remove decision fatigue. I'm not trying to win a cooking competition at 6 AM—I'm trying to fuel performance.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Morning supplements go down with breakfast:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://1stphorm.com/products/m-factor-men/?a_aid=gotHABITS" target="_blank" class="text-gold-600 dark:text-gold-400 hover:underline">M-Factor Men's Multi</a> for comprehensive vitamin coverage</li>
          <li><a href="https://1stphorm.com/products/full-mega/?a_aid=gotHABITS" target="_blank" class="text-gold-600 dark:text-gold-400 hover:underline">Full-Mega Fish Oil</a> midday for omega-3s</li>
          <li>Started hydrating immediately—close to a liter of water every 1.5 hours throughout the day</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 dark:text-white">Training: The Non-Negotiable</h2>

        <p>
          After the quick breakfast, I hit the gym. This isn't something I "fit in when I can"—it's the foundation that makes everything else possible. Physical training improves cognitive function, emotional regulation, and energy levels. Skip it, and the whole day suffers.
        </p>

        <figure class="my-10">
          <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1534438327276-14e5300c3a48?w=800&h=450&fit=crop" alt="Gym training session" class="content-image w-full">
          <figcaption class="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-3">Consistent training compounds over time</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          <strong>Post-workout, I immediately take:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://1stphorm.com/products/phormula-1/?a_aid=gotHABITS" target="_blank" class="text-gold-600 dark:text-gold-400 hover:underline">Phormula-1</a> for rapid-absorbing post-workout protein</li>
          <li>A fast-acting carb source to spike insulin and shut down cortisol production—I rotate between <a href="https://1stphorm.com/products/ignition/?a_aid=gotHABITS" target="_blank" class="text-gold-600 dark:text-gold-400 hover:underline">Ignition</a>, gummy bears when I want a treat, or pineapple (my most common choice)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The carb spike isn't about replenishing glycogen immediately—it's about shutting down the cortisol response from intense training. Left unchecked, elevated cortisol can work against your body composition goals.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 dark:text-white">The Three-Mile Treadmill Walk</h2>

        <p>
          Here's where things get strategic. Immediately following my workout, while I'm still at the gym, I hit the treadmill for three miles. This isn't random—it's calculated. After resistance training, my glycogen stores are exhausted, leaving my fat stores as the primary fuel source.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>The science is simple:</strong> you have to oxidize fat to burn it. Your level of aerobic cardio is going to dictate your fat-loss results in the long run. By walking in this glycogen-depleted state, I'm maximizing fat oxidation while the intensity stays low enough to remain in the aerobic zone.
        </p>

        <p>
          But this isn't just exercise—it's also my content creation window. While walking, I'm planning and scheduling social media posts, thinking through business problems, and recording voice notes for future content. The steady movement creates a flow state that desk work simply can't match. Some of my best strategic insights come during these treadmill sessions.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 dark:text-white">Brunch: The Real Post-Workout Meal</h2>

        <p>
          After the walk, I arrive home for what I call brunch—my substantial post-workout meal. This is where meal prep becomes critical.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>I batch prep meals every few days</strong> rather than marathon Sunday sessions. This approach keeps food fresh and prevents kitchen burnout. Every meal is weighed and constructed for my specific macros—protein, carbs, and fats dialed in precisely.
        </p>

        <p>
          The key is making healthy eating as frictionless as possible. When the food is already prepped, weighed, and ready to go, there's no temptation to order delivery or grab something convenient but suboptimal.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 dark:text-white">Deep Work: Tackling the Task List</h2>

        <p>
          With training and nutrition handled, I jump directly into my task list for the day. This is where <strong>Asana</strong> becomes essential. I use it for all planning and task management—both personal and business projects live there.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-navy-800 rounded-xl p-6 my-8">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-navy-900 dark:text-white mb-4">My Planning System</h3>
          <ul class="space-y-3">
            <li><strong>Weekly Planning:</strong> Every Sunday, I identify my "big rocks"—the 3-5 outcomes that would make the week successful</li>
            <li><strong>Daily Planning:</strong> Each morning, I select the ONE thing that must happen today</li>
            <li><strong>Time Blocking:</strong> Deep work gets protected calendar blocks—no meetings, no interruptions</li>
            <li><strong>Scheduled Appointments:</strong> Every meeting, call, and commitment goes on the calendar. If it's not scheduled, it doesn't exist.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          <strong>Distraction is the enemy.</strong> During deep work blocks, notifications are off. Email is closed. I'm doing one thing with full focus.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 dark:text-white">Eating Every Three Hours</h2>

        <p>
          I eat every three hours throughout the day. This isn't about "stoking metabolism" (that's largely a myth)—it's about maintaining stable energy levels and hitting protein targets. Each meal is an opportunity to fuel performance.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>I always keep protein bars on hand</strong> for when I'm on the go. <a href="https://1stphorm.com/products/protein-bars/?a_aid=gotHABITS" target="_blank" class="text-gold-600 dark:text-gold-400 hover:underline">Quality protein bars</a> bridge the gap when a full meal isn't practical. I also sip <a href="https://1stphorm.com/products/bcaa/?a_aid=gotHABITS" target="_blank" class="text-gold-600 dark:text-gold-400 hover:underline">BCAAs</a> in smaller servings throughout the day to support muscle recovery.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 dark:text-white">The Evening Wind-Down</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Evening supplements support recovery and sleep:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://1stphorm.com/products/m-factor-men/?a_aid=gotHABITS" target="_blank" class="text-gold-600 dark:text-gold-400 hover:underline">M-Factor Men's Multi</a> (second dose)</li>
          <li>Pre-bedtime protein shake loaded with <a href="https://1stphorm.com/products/collagen/?a_aid=gotHABITS" target="_blank" class="text-gold-600 dark:text-gold-400 hover:underline">Collagen</a>, <a href="https://1stphorm.com/products/glutamine/?a_aid=gotHABITS" target="_blank" class="text-gold-600 dark:text-gold-400 hover:underline">Glutamine</a>, and <a href="https://1stphorm.com/products/creatine-monohydrate/?a_aid=gotHABITS" target="_blank" class="text-gold-600 dark:text-gold-400 hover:underline">Creatine</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Zero, my dog, joins me for the evening walks. It's become a ritual we both look forward to—and it helps me transition from work mode to recovery mode. This ensures I get movement bookending my day, with the gym treadmill in the morning and neighborhood walks with Zero in the evening. After that, it's about preparing for quality sleep.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 dark:text-white">The Tech Stack That Keeps Me Accountable</h2>

        <p>
          I believe in measuring what matters. Here's the technology I use to track fitness, health, and progress:
        </p>

        <div class="grid sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4 my-8">
          <div class="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-navy-800 rounded-xl p-5">
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 dark:text-white mb-2">Apple Watch</h4>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">Tracks workouts, activity, heart rate, and daily movement goals</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-navy-800 rounded-xl p-5">
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 dark:text-white mb-2">Oura Ring</h4>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">Monitors sleep quality, HRV, readiness scores, and recovery</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-navy-800 rounded-xl p-5">
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 dark:text-white mb-2">Eight Sleep (Sleep 8) Bed</h4>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">Temperature-controlled mattress for optimized sleep quality</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-navy-800 rounded-xl p-5">
            <h4 class="font-bold text-navy-900 dark:text-white mb-2">HUME Scale + Aura Strap</h4>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">Advanced body composition and Apple Watch enhancement for detailed metrics</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          These tools create a feedback loop. When I can see that poor sleep correlates with lower productivity, it reinforces the importance of protecting sleep. When I see body composition trending in the right direction, it validates the nutrition approach.
        </p>

        <blockquote class="text-lg">
          "What gets measured gets managed. What gets managed gets improved."
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 dark:text-white">The Mindset: No Plan B</h2>

        <p>
          Here's the uncomfortable truth about routines: they only work if you commit fully. There is no Plan B in my approach. When I decide something is a priority—whether it's training, a business milestone, or a client commitment—alternatives don't exist.
        </p>

        <p>
          That said, we're not robots. Life happens. The key is <em>improvising within Plan A</em> rather than abandoning ship. Gym closed? Workout at home. Travel day? Adjust the nutrition plan but don't abandon macros entirely. Client emergency? Handle it, then return to the scheduled priorities.
        </p>

        <p>
          Flexibility in execution, rigidity in commitment.
        </p>

          <figcaption class="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-3">Planning is the foundation—execution is everything</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 dark:text-white">Why This Works</h2>

        <p>
          This routine isn't about being perfect. It's about being consistent. The compound effect of doing the right things day after day creates results that seem impossible when viewed in isolation.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Planning is key.</strong> Without the Asana task list, without the meal prep, without the scheduled training—I'd be reactive instead of proactive. And reactive people don't build businesses or bodies they're proud of.
