        <p class="mb-4">
          Allow me to introduce myself—my name is Lee Steven Foropoulos, a results-driven Program Manager, Fractional CTO, Senior Developer, and Database Administrator, I bring over 20 years of technical and operational leadership across SaaS, compliance, enterprise, and fitness ecosystems. My expertise spans from building robust, scalable systems to optimizing day-to-day operations that drive tangible business outcomes. Whether leading development teams, designing database architectures, or automating workflows with AI, I deliver clarity, precision, and speed.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the early 2000s, my professional odyssey began at Bredero Shaw, where I immersed myself in the realm of industrial automation and technical prowess. As a programmer, I crafted an advanced data monitoring system for Programmable Logic Controllers in expansive facilities focused on welding and coating large-scale oil pipeline segments. This endeavor underscored real-time production oversight based on equipment dynamics, cultivating my core competencies in process refinement, data analytics, and seamless integration amid rigorous manufacturing demands. It was my inaugural foray into the utilities and industrial sectors, where I pioneered workflow enhancements that elevated efficiency and precision.
        </p>
        <p>
          From May 2003 to November 2009, I ascended to the role of IT Director at Micro Images, Inc., in Mobile, Alabama, steering business expansion and operational agility through innovative technology. In close partnership with clients, partners, and marketing teams, I unveiled groundbreaking concepts, services, and products, harnessing cutting-edge technologies and APIs to forge a competitive advantage that amplified accuracy and deliverable quality. I engineered bespoke image manipulation tools to accelerate multifaceted tasks, automated intricate business workflows to surge productivity while slashing costs, and established rigorous development frameworks—including version control—to fortify organizational efficiency and product excellence. Moreover, I orchestrated the upgrade, upkeep, and administration of the local area network and Windows 2003 domain, guaranteeing flawless operations. This chapter honed my expertise in sales presentations, document management, VBA Excel, pivot tables, data analysis, process automation, and articulate communications, all while deepening my engagement in workflow optimization for private enterprises.
        </p>
        <p>
          Transitioning to SouthData, Inc. in 2009 as Systems and Logistics Manager, I championed the integration of virtualized server technology and oversaw IT infrastructure spanning multiple locations. Guiding teams and co-authoring productivity insights, I devised pioneering protocols for medical record scanning, attaining 90 percent automation in indexing via proprietary Optical Character Recognition methodologies. This era represented a transformative leap toward operational mastery, where I streamlined logistics, facilitated acquisitions through system and team consolidations, and exhibited foresight in adapting to evolving industry landscapes. My contributions extended to aiding medical institutions and government bodies with document management, retention schedules, data governance, and compliance frameworks, including HIPAA and HITECH standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          By 2012, elevating to Sales and Operations Manager at OSG/SouthData, Inc., I commanded a dynamic division encompassing seven sites and a workforce exceeding 70. Deploying data-centric strategies and tailored automations, I reimagined sales paradigms with fixed-cost digitization models, escalating successful bids by 80 percent and clinching unparalleled profit margins above 60 percent. Initiatives such as "Project Symphony" unveiled real-time dashboards for staffing and performance metrics, all while upholding stringent compliance with SSAE16 and HIPAA protocols. This phase cemented my command in fusing sales ingenuity with operational discipline, propelling advancement via strategic foresight and team invigoration. Throughout, I partnered with clientele in medical, government, insurance, and utilities arenas, optimizing workflows and bolstering data governance for private and publicly traded entities alike.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2016, I embraced the mantle of Chief Technology Officer at SixLeaf LLC, orchestrating global remote teams within a vibrant SaaS ecosystem. Scaling platforms to accommodate over 150,000 concurrent users, I instituted Agile methodologies and CI/CD pipelines, slashing release timelines and diminishing user churn by 60 percent. Architecting durable Azure Cloud infrastructures and imparting best-practice mentorship, I secured peak availability, regulatory adherence, and innovation attuned to market pulses. Simultaneously, as President of Mobicon Foundation Inc., I scaled a humble gathering into a robust annual fundraiser, attaining 501(c)(3) designation and channeling substantial donations to community initiatives—illustrating my adaptability in resource orchestration across nonprofit landscapes.
        </p>
        <p>
          From 2023 forward, my trajectory has pivoted toward business development and fractional leadership. At Lookatmedia™, as US New Business Development Lead, I cultivated client pipelines and fostered pivotal alliances, shaping strategic trajectories and cultural cohesion in nascent markets. Today, as Vice President of Sales and Marketing at Axios Services LLC, I spearhead endeavors in revenue amplification, brand elevation, and interdisciplinary synergy, leveraging a rich tapestry of experience to yield tangible triumphs. Across my career—encompassing domains like the Department of Defense, medical, government, insurance, utilities, aerospace, and shipbuilding—I have collaborated with private organizations, government agencies, nonprofits, and publicly traded companies to refine and elevate workflows. My enduring focus on advancing document management, retention protocols, data governance, and compliance has consistently converted operational hurdles into enduring efficiencies, fostering success in diverse industries.
