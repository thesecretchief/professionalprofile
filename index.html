        <p class="mb-4">
          My career spans over two decades in technology, operations, sales, and leadership, with a consistent focus on driving efficiency, innovation, and growth across diverse industries. Below, I outline key roles and contributions in a chronological format for clarity.
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-1xl font-semibold text-indigo-700 mb-4">Early Career: Building Technical Foundations (Early 2000s)</h4>
        <p class="mb-4">
          At Bredero Shaw, I began as a programmer, developing an advanced data monitoring system for Programmable Logic Controllers in large-scale oil pipeline facilities. This role emphasized real-time production oversight, process refinement, data analytics, and integration in high-demand manufacturing environments, marking my entry into utilities and industrial sectors with workflow enhancements that boosted efficiency and precision.
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-1xl font-semibold text-indigo-700 mb-4">IT Director at Micro Images, Inc. (May 2003 – November 2009, Mobile, AL)</h4>
        <p class="mb-4">
          I led business expansion and operational agility through innovative technology. Collaborating with clients, partners, and marketing teams, I introduced new concepts, services, and products using cutting-edge technologies and APIs to enhance accuracy and quality. Key achievements included engineering custom image manipulation tools, automating business workflows to increase productivity and reduce costs, and implementing development frameworks like version control for better efficiency. I also managed network upgrades, maintenance, and administration of the Windows 2003 domain. This period sharpened my skills in sales presentations, document management, VBA Excel, pivot tables, data analysis, process automation, and communications, while optimizing workflows for private enterprises.
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-1xl font-semibold text-indigo-700 mb-4">Systems and Logistics Manager at SouthData, Inc. (2009 – 2012)</h4>
        <p class="mb-4">
          I integrated virtualized server technology and oversaw IT infrastructure across multiple sites. Leading teams, I co-authored productivity reports and developed protocols for medical record scanning, achieving 90% automation in indexing via proprietary Optical Character Recognition. This role involved streamlining logistics, supporting acquisitions through system and team integrations, and adapting to industry changes. I assisted medical and government entities with document management, retention, data governance, and compliance (HIPAA, HITECH). Project management was central, coordinating cross-account initiatives and systems to ensure seamless operations and compliance.

        <h4 class="text-1xl font-semibold text-indigo-700 mb-4">Sales and Operations Manager at OSG/SouthData, Inc. (2012 – 2016)</h4>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Commanding a division with seven sites and over 70 employees, I deployed data-driven strategies and automations to revamp sales with fixed-cost digitization models, boosting successful bids by 80% and achieving 60%+ profit margins. Projects like "Project Symphony" introduced real-time dashboards for staffing and metrics, maintaining SSAE16 and HIPAA compliance. I fused sales innovation with operational excellence, invigorating teams and advancing strategic goals. Project management across accounts and systems was key, overseeing complex workflows for clients in medical, government, insurance, and utilities sectors, optimizing data governance for private and public entities.
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-1xl font-semibold text-indigo-700 mb-4">Chief Technology Officer at SixLeaf LLC (2016 – 2023)</h4>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Orchestrating global remote teams in a SaaS environment, I scaled platforms to support 150,000+ concurrent users, implemented Agile and CI/CD pipelines, reduced release cycles, and cut user churn by 60%. I architected Azure Cloud infrastructures, mentored on best practices, and ensured availability, compliance, and market-aligned innovation. Concurrently, as President of Mobicon Foundation Inc., I grew an annual event into a major fundraiser, securing 501(c)(3) status and directing donations to communities—demonstrating resource management in nonprofits. Project management was integral, leading product development, deployments, and system integrations across international accounts.
